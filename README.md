# socialpartitioning

This personal art game project is about visualizing the possible relationship space between two people. 
The game shows dynamic dialogue branching sampling using clickable tiles which are set on a classic orthogonally projected level. 
The dialogue space is viewed as probabilistic and chaotic, but pro-determined by both the social context and personality traits. 
In short, the game is a social modelling creation that focuses on character design, a space partitioning layout and random sampling methods.
